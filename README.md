# Diagonal-Difference-ALGO.This implementation calculates the absolute difference between the sums of a square matrix's two diagonals by iterating through the matrix once, adding elements from the primary diagonal (top-left to bottom-right) and secondary diagonal (top-right to bottom-left), then returning the absolute difference, efficiently solving the problem in O(n) time complexity.
